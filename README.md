# Advertising-ROI-Prediction

# Objective :
Identify the Which Platform have more impact on Sales
To build the Model which will help to Predict the future sales based on Money invest in Different Platform for advertisement

# Steps:-
1.Data Collection:
Gather historical data on sales.
Collect data on advertising spending across different platforms (e.g., TV, radio, digital ads, social media).
Include other relevant variables like seasonality, promotions, pricing changes, and competitor activities.

2.Data Preprocessing:
Clean the data, handle missing values, and transform variables if necessary.
Create time series data if you have data over time.

3.Model Selection:
Regression Models: Linear regression, multiple regression for marketing mix modeling.

4.Model Training and Evaluation:
Split your data into training and testing sets.
Train the chosen model on the training data.
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics like R-squared,  Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

5.Impact Analysis:
Analyze the model coefficients to understand the impact of each advertising platform on sales.
Determine which platforms have the highest return on investment (ROI).

6.Sales Prediction:
Use the trained model to predict future sales based on different advertising investment scenarios.
